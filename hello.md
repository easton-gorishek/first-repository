# Hello ACL

### I'm currently in VScode editing the hello.md file I've created. 

1. I'm adding some markdown language to this file.
1. Adding more lines of text.
1. I'm previewing this code in live time within VScode 

I'm going to bold a word right **now**, and then I'm going to italicize a word _too_.

**THIS IS AWESOME!**
